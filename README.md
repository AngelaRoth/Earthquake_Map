### Version 2.0

Some aspects of this site are adequate for demonstrating knowledge of programming concepts, but could be improved in the next version:

* A lot of the New York Times articles appear to be from 3rd party news agencies, and are "No Longer Available" on the NYT website. The headlines and "snippets" are still available, but clicking on the url link brings sad disappointment. I am going to investigate the [Reuters API](https://newsapi.org/reuters-api): perhaps they better maintain their links.
